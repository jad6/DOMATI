This is the iOS part for Jad's Final Year Thesis on Dynamic Object Modelling for Advanced Touch Interactions

Current standard touch interactions on familiar multitouch devices such as smartphones and tablets are limited. Devices are aware of: the location of a touch on the display, the time of the interaction, the current phase (beginning, dragging, end) of the touch, and the number of repetitive interactions such as a double or triple taps. In addition to these variables, further information could be extrapolated to facilitate new ways of controlling software.

This Final Year Project aims to enable multitouch devices to recognise 'advanced touch interactions' (standard interactions which also take into account the strength of a touch). Further, a software application will be created to model the effects of advanced touch interactions on a 3D rendered object. Strength detection algorithms combining the radius and duration of a touch along with its effect on a gyroscope and accelerometer will be researched, implemented, tested and calibrated. This project aims to significantly improve software for scientific research, open up new user interfaces, and enrich entertainment applications.
